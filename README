Checklist to ensure that zeroconf will work:

1) Install Avahi, at least version 0.3
2) compile kdnssd-avahi and install it to replace 'stub' libkdnssd.so provided by kdelibs
3) check /etc/nsswitch.conf and ensure that there is 'mdns' before 'dns' in
line starting with 'host:'. It should be something like:
host: files mdns dns
4) ensure that avahi-daemon is being started in initscripts
5) for testing: use kpf kicker applet to publish a directory, then open 'zeroconf:/'
URL in konqueror. You should be able to see a local webserver with that published dir.
